## Description

This mod fixes suggestions in chat, allowing the player to suggest names of recipes, loot tables, functions, etc. without taking into account the namespace name.

## Original mod

My mod is inspired by the original [Suggestion Provider Fix](https://modrinth.com/mod/suggestionproviderfix) mod by [Harleyoc1](https://modrinth.com/user/Harleyoc1) and is made for newer versions of the Fabric loader.

Below is an example of the mod in action:
